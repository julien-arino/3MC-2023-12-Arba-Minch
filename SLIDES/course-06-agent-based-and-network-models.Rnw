\section{Motivation -- More about incidence}

\begin{frame}{Incidence function versus force of infection}
Two different forms for the rate of movement of $S$ individuals from $S$ to whatever infected compartment they end up in:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $S'=-f(S,I,N)$ is an \defword{incidence function}
	\item $S'=-\lambda(S,I,N)S$ is a \defword{force of infection}
\end{itemize} 
\vfill
The two are of course essentially equivalent, the context tends to drive the form used. Advanced PDE models that consider for instance an age-of-infection structure need to integrate over $I(t,a)$ and thus often use force of infection, others are somewhat random..
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Interactions -- Infection}
\bbullet Rate at which new cases appear per unit time is the \emph{incidence function}
\[
f(S,I,N)
\]
\vfill
\bbullet Depends of the number $S$ of susceptible individuals, $I$ of infectious individuals and, sometimes, of the total population $N$
\vfill
\bbullet Incidence includes two main components
\begin{itemize}
	\item a denumeration of the number of contacts taking place
	\item a description of the probability that such a contact, when it takes place, results in the transmission of the pathogen
\end{itemize}
\vfill
\bbullet Choosing an appropriate function is hard and probably one of the flunkiest part of epidemic modelling
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two most frequently used functions}
The two most frequently used incidence functions are \defword{mass action incidence}
\[
f(S,I, N)=\beta SI
\]
and \defword{standard} (or \defword{proportional}) \defword{incidence}
\[
f(S,I, N)=\beta\frac{SI}{N}
\]
\vfill
In both cases, $\beta$ is the \defword{disease transmission coefficient}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Units of $\beta$}
Recall that if $X(t)$ is the population in compartment $X$ at time $t$, then $X'$ has units $\text{number}/\text{time}$
\vfill
In a differential equation, left and right hand side must have same units, so..
\vfill
\textbf{Mass action incidence}
$$
\beta SI \propto
\beta\times\text{number}\times\text{number}
$$
has units number/time if $\beta$ has units $1/(\text{number}\times\text{time})$
\vfill
\textbf{Standard incidence}
$$
\beta SI/N \propto
\beta\times\text{number}\times\text{number}/\text{number} \propto \beta \times\text{number}
$$
has units number/time if $\beta$ has units $1/\text{time}$
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Mass action incidence}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incidence_mass_action}
f(S,I, N)=\beta SI
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is homogenous mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals
\item Strong hypothesis: each individual potentially meets every other individual
\end{itemize}
\vfill
In this case, one of the most widely accepted interpretations is that all susceptible individuals can come across all infectious individuals (hence the name, by analogy with gas dynamics in chemistry/physics)
\vfill
When population is large, the hypothesis becomes unrealistic
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Standard (proportional) incidence}
The other form used frequently:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incidence_proportional}
f(S,I,N)=\beta\frac{SI}{N}
\end{equation}
\vfill
Each susceptible individual meets a fraction of the infectious individuals
\vfill
Or vice-versa! See, e.g., Hethcote, \href{https://doi-org.uml.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/0025-5564(76)90132-2}{Qualitative analyses of communicable disease models}, \emph{Mathematical Biosciences} (1976)
\vfill
Case of a larger population
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Constant population $\implies$ $\eqref{eq:incidence_mass_action}$ $\equiv$ $\eqref{eq:incidence_proportional}$}
When the total population is constant, a lot of incidence function are equivalent (to units)
\vfill
Suppose $N(t)\equiv N_0$, then
$$
\beta SI = \tilde\beta\frac{SI}{N}
\iff \tilde\beta=N_0\beta
$$
and if the right hand side is satisfied, then $\eqref{eq:incidence_mass_action}$ and $\eqref{eq:incidence_proportional}$ identical
\vfill
Keep in mind units are different, though
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{General incidence}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:general_incidence}
f(S,I,N)=\beta S^q I^p
\end{equation}
These functions were introduced with data fitting in mind: fitting to data, find the $p,q$ best matching the available data
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Incidence with refuge}
The following implements a refuge effect; it assumes that a proportion $0<q<1$ of the population is truly susceptible, because of, e.g., spatial heterogeneity
\vfill
\begin{equation}\label{eq:incidence_with_refuge}
f(S,I,N)=
\begin{cases}
\beta I\left(N-\dfrac Iq\right),&\textrm{if }I<qN \\
0,&\textrm{if }I\geq qN
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Negative binomial incidence}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:neg_binom_incidence}
f(S,I,N)=kS\ln\left(1+\beta\frac Ik\right)
\end{equation}
\vfill
For small values of $k$, this function describes a very concentrated infection process, while when $k\to\infty$, this function reduces to a mass action incidence
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Asymptotic contact}
$$
f(S,I,N)
=\frac{N}{1-\varepsilon+\varepsilon N}
\frac{F(S,I)}{N}
$$
where $F$ is one of the functions we just described
\vfill
When $\varepsilon=0$, contacts are proportionnal to $N$, whereas when $\varepsilon=1$, contacts are independent from $N$
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Asymptomatic transmission}
$$
f(S,I,N)
=\beta\frac{SI}{c+S+I}
$$
where $c$ is a constant. E.g.,
$$
\frac{C(N)}N F(S,I)
$$
with $C(N)=N/(1-\varepsilon+\varepsilon N)$ the function describing the contact rate and $F(S,I)$ the function describing disease spread, assumed here to be of negative binomial incidence-type
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Switching incidence}
Arino \& McCluskey, \href{https://doi.org/10.1080/17513751003793017}{Effect of a sharp change of the incidence function on the dynamics of a simple disease}, \emph{Journal of Biological Dynamics} (2010)
\vfill
Scale population so switch occurs at $N=1$ and suppose
$$
F(S,I,N) =
\begin{cases}
\beta SI & \textrm{if }N\leq 1 \\
\beta \dfrac{SI}{N} & \textrm{if }N> 1
\end{cases}
$$
In SIS with non-constant population
\begin{align}
S' &= bN-dS-F(S,I,N)+\gamma I \\
I' &= F(S,I,N)-(d+\delta+\gamma)I
\end{align}
$b\neq d$ and $\delta$ disease-induced death rate, periodic solutions found
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Why all this mess?}
Because contact processes are really really complicated and that describing them mathematically is \textbf{hard}!
\vfill
Agent-based models (ABM) and network models provide a way to better understand contact processes at the micro-scale 
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Agent-based models (ABM)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{What are agent-based models}

\begin{frame}{ABM $\neq$ IBM}
Early in the life of these models, they were called IBM (individual-based models)
\vfill
Over the years, a ``philosophical'' distinction has emerged:
\begin{itemize}
\item IBM are mathematical models that consider individuals as the units; e.g., DTMC, CTMC, branching processes, etc.
\item ABM are computational models whose study is, for the most part, only possible numerically
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{ABM vs Network models}
Network models endow vertices with simple systems and couple them through graphs
\vfill
Can be ABM, but some networks can also be studied analytically
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{When to use ABM}

\begin{frame}{ABM are very useful to decipher contact processes}
Classic mathematical models capture contact by using approximations of what contact could be like
\vfill
Classic models allow some flexibility (see section about incidence functions in Lecture X but they remain limited
\vfill
ABM can model actual trajectories of individuals, so given a definition of what a contact is (how close do you need to be for a contact to take place), can count them efficaciously
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{ABM are very useful to understand behavioural responses}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{When not to use ABM}

\begin{frame}{As with \emph{all} tools, beware!}
There is a law of large numbers effects happening often: if you have many units, unless some emergent behaviour arises, you get the same results using ODEs...
\vfill
With this specific tool, beware!
\vfill
There is a certain tendency in CS people to create \emph{yet another} system and seek \emph{adoption} by users
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Some examples}

\begin{frame}{Antibiotic resistance in hospitals}
D’Agata, Magal, Olivier, Ruan \& Webb. \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.011}{Modeling antibiotic resistance in hospitals: The impact of minimizing treatment duration}, Journal of Theoretical Biology (2007)
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{An IBM that's almost an ABM}
This work is a good illustration of the ``cultural proximity'' between IBM and ABM
\vfill
Model is stochastic and individual-based, in good enough form that approximating ODE can be derived
\vfill
Allows for very specific tracking of the status of individuals through the process (almost an ABM in this sense)
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The setup}
Three processes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item admission and exit of patients
\item infection of patients by HCW (health care workers)
\item contamination of HCW by patients
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
Contamination of HCW is ``transient'': they are carriers, if they wash their hands properly, they become OK
\vfill
Each day has 3 shifts of 8h for HCW
\vfill
Patients are put in contact by visits of HCW
\vfill
Rules for contaminations per unit time
\end{frame}

\tiny Patient–HCW contact diagram for four patients and one HCW during one shift. Patient status: uninfected (green), infected with the non-resistant strain (yellow), infected with the resistant strain (red).

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

The left (respectively the right) figure corresponds to 1 trajectory (respectively the average over 80 trajectories) of the IBM during one shift, with no exit and admission of patients, and no changes in the infection status of patients

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contacts during Hajj}
In a mass gathering event like Hajj, lots of people come together originating from many countries
\vfill
So if propagation occurs during the event, this has the capacity to spread infection far and wide when individuals (pilgrims here) return home
\vfill
Contacts during part of the event are really specific in their configuration
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The setup}
Word of warning: I am quite fuzzy on the specifics :)
\vfill
Pilgrims enter Masjid al-Haram mosque through several gates
\vfill
Proceed to Mataaf (area around Kaaba), circle the Kaaba 7 times counterclockwise (process is the \emph{Tawaf})
\vfill
Then do seven trips between Safa and Marwah (process is the \emph{Sa'ee})
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FIGS/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca.jpg}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
As you can gather from this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically high density crowds
\item Very specific mixing patterns
\end{itemize}
\vfill
Opportunities for transmission are very high
\vfill
However, control mechanisms are also available
\vfill
$\implies$ understanding contact patterns and frequency would help

\subsection{Why use network models}

\begin{frame}{Understand contact processes}
Classic models allow a certain degree of flexibility, for instance by using specific incidence functions or group models, but this remains limited and an approximation
\vfill
Like ABM, network models are used to make more realistic descriptions of the transmission of pathogens
\end{frame}

\end{frame}



\subsection{Social networks}

\begin{frame}
Before considering epidemics in networks, it is useful to learn a few notions of social network theory, as this is very useful to understand networks
\vfill
Social network methods introduce measures that allow to evaluate some properties of graphs
\vfill
A network is a (mathematical) graph, oriented or not, in which edges/arcs represent connections (whathever they are) between individuals, who make up the vertices of the graph
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Context}
\bbullet $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ an undirected graph
\vfill
\bbullet $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{A})$ a digraph (directed graph)
\vfill
\bbullet $\mathcal{V}$ the set of vertices (or nodes)
\vfill
\bbullet $\mathcal{E}$ the set of edges (undirected case)
\vfill
\bbullet $\mathcal{A}$ the set of arcs (directed graph)

\subsubsection{Centrality -- Betweenness and closeness}
\begin{frame}{How \emph{central} is a vertex?}
	\emph{Centrality} tries to answer the question: what are the most influent vertices?
\vfill
	We have seen central vertices and vertices on the periphery, let us consider two other measures of centrality
	\begin{itemize}
			\item Betweenness centrality
			\item Closeness centrality
	\end{itemize}
	\vfill
	Many other forms (we will come back to this, e.g., degree centrality)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Betweenness}
\begin{definition}[Betweenness]
	$G=(X,U)$ a graph, $x\in X$. The \defword{betweenness} of $v$ is
	\[
	b_\D(v)= \sum_{s\neq t\neq v  \in X} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
	\]
	where
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sigma_{st}$ number of shortest geodesic paths from $s$ to $t$
	\item $\sigma_{st}(v)$ number of shortest geodesic paths from $s$ to $t$ through $v$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\vfill
In other words
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each pair of vertices $(s,t)$, compute the shortest paths between them
	\item For each pair of vertices $(s,t)$, determine the fraction of shortest paths that pass through vertex $v$
	\item Sum this fraction over all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Normalising betweenness}
	Betweenness may be normalized by dividing through the number of pairs of vertices not including $v$:
	\vfill
	\begin{itemize}
		\item for directed graphs, $(n-1)(n-2)$
		\vfill
		\item for undirected graphs, $(n-1)(n-2)/2$

	Recall that betweenness of $v$ is
	\[
		b_\D(v)= \sum_{s\neq t\neq v  \in X} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
	\]
	\vfill
	$\sigma_{st}$ (\# shortest paths from $s$ to $t$) is found in the matrix above
	\vfill
	What about $\sigma_{st}(v)$, \# of those shortest paths that go through $v$?

		\item Minimum and maximum in/out-degree. E.g., if you consider the global air transportation network and the in/out-degree of airports, in-degree is a measure of a location's ``popularity'' as a travel destination
		\item Range of degrees in a graph: are there large discrepancies in connectivity between vertices in the graph?
		\item Average degree (often denoted $\langle k\rangle$ because of physicists)
		\item Average in/out-degree
		\item Variance of the degrees or in/out-degrees

\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
Typically, consider a graph (or digraph, depending on the cases) in which
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Each vertex is an individual
\vfill
\item Existence of an arc from $i$ to $j$ indicates that $i$ is in contact with $j$ and can transmit the pathogen to them
\vfill
\item in the undirected case, existence of an arc from $i$ to $j$ implies existence of an arc (the same) from $j$ to $i$ and establishes that the two individuals are connected
\vfill
\item The connection is not permanent, but rather describes the possibility of a connection: $i$ and $j$ regularly come into contact
\end{itemize}
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Adjacency matrix}
We often use the \defword{adjacency matrix} $A=[a_{ij}]$ in which $a_{ij}=1$ if node $i$ has a link to node $j$ and $a_{ij}=0$ otherwise
\vfill
We sometimes write $A(\mathcal{D})$ to indicate that $A$ is the adjacency matrix of digraph $\mathcal{D}$ and, in the other direction, $\mathcal{D}(A)$ to indicate that the graph is constructed using the adjacency matrix
\vfill
If the graph is undirected, then$A$ is symmetrical
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Nature of the network}
\bbullet Sometimes we have precise data about links between individuals (polls, surveys, etc.)
\vfill
\bbullet Often networks are ``idealised'', networks are chosen with specified properties
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Distribution of vertex degrees}
The \defword{transmissibility} of a disease in a graph/digraph is the average probability that an infectious individual transmits the disease to a susceptible individual they are in contact with
\vfill
In an uncorrelated network,
\[
T_c = \frac{\langle k\rangle}{\langle k^2\rangle-\langle k\rangle}
\]
where $\langle k\rangle$ and $\langle k^2\rangle$ are the mean and mean square degree
\vfill
There must hold that $T>T_c$ for an \emph{outbreak} to turn into a major epidemic
