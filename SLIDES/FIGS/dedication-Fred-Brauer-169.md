# <!--fit-->In Memoriam - Fred Brauer

Fred Brauer was a friend and mentor to many worldwide and an *Ã©minence grise* of Mathematical Epidemiology in Canada

I was privileged to learn from him and teach math epi with him all over the place

Fred passed away 2021-10-17. He would have loved to teach you about about math epi and share pearls of wisdom from the *Eminent Modern Philosopher* Yogi Berra!
