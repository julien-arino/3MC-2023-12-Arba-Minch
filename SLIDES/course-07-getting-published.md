# Plan of this Course

- A biased process
- Getting published is hard work
- Some recommendations

# <!--fit-->A biased process

---

# Observations

There is plenty of research showing that:
- If you are a researcher in a "southern country," it is more challenging to publish your work in high-quality journals
- The editorial process is subject to systemic biases
- Coming from a prestigious university or a wealthy country increases the chances of publication

---

# Things are changing

- Some countries now have clear policies in favor of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI)
- We are now trained in these topics, taught to identify biases, and to combat them

---

# There's still a long way to go

- These changes will be felt if you work in a country with such policies, not everywhere
- These notions are integrated into the publishing world as people trained in these topics join the editorial boards of journals

# <!--fit-->Getting published is hard work

---

# Publishing is never easy
- Even for an established, non-discriminated researcher working in a wealthy country, it is not always easy to get certain papers accepted because the competition is intense

---

# You can and should help yourself

- If you are a researcher from the south, you are likely to face discrimination
- It is important to minimize the risks of having your work rejected for reasons other than discrimination
  - Understand the editorial process
  - Identify things to avoid

# <!--fit-->Understanding the paper evaluation process

- Publications in reputable journals are more widely read than those in lesser-known journals; do not hesitate to aim high!
- In good journals, you can expect fair treatment
- **BUT** good journals receive *a lot* of papers and publish far fewer, so you are in competition for space
- If you want a chance, your paper must be written to a high standard

---

# Preprocessing

- When an editor-in-chief receives a paper, he/she selects a *handling editor*, i.e., an editor who will handle the paper
- The handling editor reads the paper:
    - Is the paper within the scope of the journal?
    - Is the paper in line with the journal's editorial policy?
    - Is the paper readable?

---

# Passing the preprocessing stage

- Preprocessing involves a less detailed reading than that done by the reviewers.
- Generally, major errors will be noticed, but an error in a proof, for example, may not be found
- The abstract, introduction, and conclusion are usually read, so it is crucial that the subject is well articulated in the introduction

---

# Anti-plagiarism scan (Caution!)

- Part of preprocessing

# ChatGPT/GitHub Copilot are your friends ... partly

- Do not use to produce text, it will be weird (and detected)
- ChatGPT 3.5 (free version) generates fake citations (known issue!)
- However, they excel at stuff like identifying/correcting spelling and grammar issues! I would strongly recommend using this
